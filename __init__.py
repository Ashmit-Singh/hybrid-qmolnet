# Hybrid QMolNet package initialization
"""
Hybrid Graph Neural Network + Variational Quantum Neural Network
for Drug Molecule Property Prediction from SMILES

This package implements a complete hybrid quantum-classical pipeline:
SMILES → RDKit molecular graph → GNN encoder → embedding compression → VQC → classifier
